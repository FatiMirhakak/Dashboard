# Student-Friendly Dashboard Project

This project is part of **Course 8 Activities**, where we learned how to create visualizations and dashboards using Python libraries and tools like **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Dash**.

## 📊 What the Dashboard Does

Our dashboard helps turn raw data into **clear and interactive visuals**.  
The dataset we used was taken from **Kaggle**, and after cleaning and exploring it, we built visualizations to show trends, comparisons, and relationships in the data.

### Features of the Dashboard:
- ✅ **Bar Charts** – compare categories easily.  
- ✅ **Line & Area Charts** – track trends over time.  
- ✅ **Waffle Charts** – show category composition.  
- ✅ **Regression Plots** – explore relationships between variables.  
- ✅ **Maps (Folium / Choropleth)** – visualize geospatial data.  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas & NumPy** → for data cleaning and preparation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → for static visualizations  
- **Plotly Express** → for interactive charts  
- **Dash** → for building the interactive dashboard  
- **Folium** → for maps

## 🚀 How We Built It
1. **Dataset Selection** – Picked from Kaggle (CSV format).  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, corrected datatypes.  
3. **Exploration** – Used quick plots to understand the data.  
4. **Visualization** – Created multiple charts with different libraries.  
5. **Dashboard** – Added dropdowns, filters, and interactive elements.  
6. **Insights** – Explained what each chart shows and what story the data tells.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters
This project makes data analysis **student-friendly** by combining learning with practice.  
It shows how raw data can be turned into meaningful insights using **Python visualization tools**.
